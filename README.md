# AI Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to help users upload, clean, convert, and visualize datasets, as well as apply various AI and machine learning techniques. It is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web interface and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for advanced data visualizations.

## Features

- **Dataset Upload:** Easily upload CSV files for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** View the first rows, summary statistics, and data types of your dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data and model results using interactive Plotly charts.
- **AI Techniques:** Apply machine learning models such as Regression and KMeans Clustering to your data.
- **Extensible:** The project is a work in progress, with plans to add more models and data cleaning/conversion features.

## Getting Started

1. **Install requirements:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the dashboard:**

   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

3. **Upload your dataset and start exploring!**

## Roadmap

- [x] Regression and KMeans Clustering models
- [ ] Data cleaning and conversion tools
- [ ] Additional AI/ML models (e.g., classification, dimensionality reduction)
- [ ] Enhanced visualizations and reporting

## Technologies Used

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
